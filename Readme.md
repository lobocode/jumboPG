## Introduction

This project aims to create a tool that generates a customized postgresql.conf file based on user inputs from a web interface. The tool will be written in Haskell and the web interface will be built using the React framework.

## Problem

When setting up a PostgreSQL database, the configuration file postgresql.conf is a critical piece that determines the behavior of the database system. However, manually editing this file can be a complex and error-prone task, as the file contains many parameters that need to be properly tuned to achieve optimal performance and stability. Additionally, there are many possible combinations of parameter settings that can be suitable for different use cases, making it difficult for users to choose the right configuration for their needs.

The proposed solution is to build a web-based tool that allows users to select the most important configuration parameters from a user-friendly interface, and then generates a customized postgresql.conf file based on the selected parameters. The tool will use the Haskell programming language to perform the actual file generation based on user inputs, and the React framework to build the web interface.

## Architecture

The architecture of the system can be divided into two main components: the web interface and the backend file generation. The web interface will be built using React and will communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs. The backend will be built using Haskell and will generate the postgresql.conf file based on the user inputs received from the frontend.

## Features

The main features of the tool will include:

* A user-friendly web interface that allows users to select the most important configuration parameters.
* Validation of user inputs to ensure that only valid values are accepted.
* Generation of a customized postgresql.conf file based on the user inputs.
* Support for a wide range of configuration parameters that can be selected by the user.
* A user guide that explains the purpose and meaning of each configuration parameter.


The proposed tool will provide an easy-to-use solution for generating customized postgresql.conf files for users who are not familiar with the complexities of PostgreSQL configuration. By using Haskell for the file generation and React for the web interface, we can ensure that the tool is reliable, efficient, and easy to maintain
